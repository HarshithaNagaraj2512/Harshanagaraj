# 1. A list can be created using [] parantheces
# 2. spam.append('hello')
# 3. d
# 4. d
# 5. ['a', 'b']
# 6. 1
# 7. [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99] adds the value 99 at the end of the list
# 8. fisrt str 'cat' at index 1  has been removed
# 9. list concatenation(+) comibine two or more list into a single list where as list replication(*) multiplies the string.
# 10. append adds an element at the end of the list where as using insert we can add at particualar index.
# 11. remove and pop
# 12. list is collection of values which can be int,str, complex or an another list and string is sequence of characters.
# 13. a. List consists of mutable objects whereas tuple consists of immutable objects
#     b. An element of the list can be removed or replaced whereas it is not possible in case of tuple
#     c. List has large memory since it is stored in two blocks of memory and tuples hav single block of memory which makes tuple consume less memory
#     d. A list data is stored [] and tuples  data is stored in ().
# 14. By adding a comma after the element 42

#     l = list(t)
#     print(l)
# 16. they can be tuples dictionary 
# 17. copy.copy()constructs a new compound object and then  inserts references into it to the objects found in the original. 
#     copy.deepcopy() constructs a new compound object and then, recursively, inserts copies into it of the objects found in the original.
